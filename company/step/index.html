            <h2 class="title">Our Roots</h2>
            <p>AR BROWN McFARLANE & CO., LTD was born in 1889 (Meiji 22) in Glasgow, the center of British industry. The company is a trading company founded by Albert Brown, also known as "Captain Brown," who significantly contributed to the development of Japanese shipping during the Meiji Restoration, and it was AR Brown McFarlane that is the root of today's AR Brown.</p>
            <p>The founder, Albert Richard Brown, was born in 1839 in Ringwood Hampshire, England. In 1867 Brown came to Japan as the chief officer of the British ship "Melaka". The following year, Brown became the captain of the lighthouse supply ship "Fuomaru" at the request of the Meiji government. Later, Brown participated in the founding of the first merchant ship school in Japan (currently Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology) as an instructor for the training of the crew of the merchant fleet, and also became the first general manager of NYK (Nippon Yusen Kaisha) Line in 1885. In 1901, Brown was the first foreigner to be bestowed with the Order of the Sacred Treasure from the Emperor Meiji.</p>
            <p>(Incidentally, the Japanese holiday "Marine Day" which is celebrated on July 20th, derives from the day when the Emperor Meiji returned to Yokohama Port on the ship the "Meiji Maru" brought by Captain Brown during his return to the Tohoku region in 1897, and furthermore, "Meiji Maru" also contributes to the acquisition of sovereignty over the Ogasawara Islands.) </p>

            <h2 class="title">AR Brown McFarlane Opens Tokyo Branch<br><span>(From Postwar Reconstruction to High Economic Growth)</span></h2>
            <img src="img/sec02.jpg" alt="" class="sec02_img">
            <p>In 1949, Japan faced a period of reconstruction from the damage of World War II. At this time, Captain Brown's grandson, Richard Brown, came to Japan in order to restore traditional trade with Japan, following the wishes of his grandfather. AR Brown McFarlane established a branch office in Tokyo and played a role in the promotion of the reconstruction of Japanese industry. For example, in 1953, the company delivered a television from PYE in the United Kingdom to Hayama Imperial Villa. In 1960, a stereoscopic television device was installed at the Tokai Mura Atomic Energy Research Institute, and a 74-inch reflecting telescope (manufactured by Sir Howard Grubb, Parsons and Co. Ltd. UK) was installed at the Okayama Astronomical Observatory of the University of Tokyo. In addition, by further importing chemical industrial products such as silicone and radioisotopes, and mechanical metals, the company provided vitality to Japanese industry and played a part in achieving postwar reconstruction.</p>
            <p>In 1968, the Japanese economy entered a period of dramatic development under a policy of high economic growth, and became the second largest economy in the world by GNP. Actually, during this time of uncertain economic history, the Tokyo branch of AR Brown McFarlane engaged in expanding its front line business as a trading company using chemicals, silicones, eye soaps, and machinery as strategic products. AR Brown McFarlane has developed flexible and multi-faceted business activities by shifting to new fields such as the automobile and electronics industries which continue to grow as part of Japan's core industries.</p>

            <h2 class="title">Birth of AR Brown</h2>
            <img src="img/sec03.png" alt="" class="sec03_img">
            <p>In 1970, the Tokyo branch of AR Brown McFarlane was reborn as a Japanese corporation and was inherited by Boxi Brown Co., Ltd. This is because, in order to respond to intensifying competition that accompanies the liberalization of trade, AR Brown strongly called for the formation of a business style which was more market orientated by moving away from the restrictive style of organization common in branches of foreign trading companies. With its traditional spirit which was famous for its resistance to adversity, AR Brown overcame economic recessions such as the oil crisis of the 1970s and achieved a solid foundation as an organization, while also achieving participation in the field of physics and chemistry products as well as fine chemicals by concluding agency contracts with top global manufacturers. AR Brown is also entering into the business field in the near future.</p>
            <p>The shares were inherited from the parent company in 1988, and a new corporate concept was launched in search of a new Brown spirit. Using the opportunity of the 40th anniversary of its founding in 1989, the company increased its capital by 50 million yen and securely laid the groundwork for corporate revitalization in anticipation of the 21st century, such as the creation of overseas bases. In 1995, the company name was changed to AR Brown Co., Ltd., and thus established its independence both in name and reality.</p>

            <h2 class="title">Strengthening Corporate Structure and Expansion into Asia </h2>
            <p>When AR Brown became independent, it was a period in which Japan faced a severe economic environment, which is often described as a period of 20 blank years following the collapse of the bubble economy. Following this, although there was a period when the economy headed toward a phase of recovery led by external demand, the financial crisis which originated in the so-called Lehman shock in September 2008 caused the economy to rapidly deteriorate into a global recession. In addition, Japan experienced unprecedented damage from the Great East Japan Earthquake in March 2011, and overseas, unstable economic conditions such as Yen appreciation and the continuation of financial crises in various European countries, represented a series of situations in which corporate management was difficult to maneuver.</p>
            <p>Under such circumstances, AR Brown initiated a review of its corporate philosophy by carrying out successive corporate transformations such as the formation of a management vision, establishing workshops with employees, further strengthening its financial position so that it is not adversely affected by the economy, and investing in new product development. Then, AR Brown established a subsidiary in Shanghai in 2011, in Bangkok in 2014, in Gurgaon in India in 2018, and in Seoul in 2019 as bases for expanding into Asia in order to demonstrate a new spirit of an adventure in line with its management philosophy.</p>
