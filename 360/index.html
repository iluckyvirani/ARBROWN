            <h2>ROOTS<span>Born in the United Kingdom growing up in Asia.</span></h2>
            <p>AR Brown’s roots is A.R Brown McFarlane & Co Ltd which was founded in 1889 by Albert Richard Brown (Captain Brown) in his hometown of Glasgow, Scotland. Captain Brown began construction of a lighthouse as an engineer of the Meiji Government, imported numerous ships such as the famous Meiji Maru (see *) from the United Kingdom and the United States, and contributed to the establishment of present-day Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology. In 1885 he was inaugurated as the first General Manager of Nippon Yusen Kaisha Line, and in 1909, he was the first foreigner to receive the Second-Class Order of the Sacred Treasure from the Emperor Meiji awarding his contributions to the Wealth and Military Strength policy of the Meiji Era via enhancing Japan’s shipping capabilities.</p>
              <p>The Tokyo Branch of A.R. Brown McFarlane & Co Ltd., which was founded in the Ginza District of Tokyo by Captain Brown’s grandson, Richard Pine Brown, during the post-war turmoil of 1949, 60 years after Captain Brown founded A.R. Brown McFarlane in Glasgow, is the present-day AR Brown Co., Ltd.</p>

The company played an important role in the postwar Japanese economic recovery by contributing to improving the quality of Made in Japan products.</p>

                  The Tokyo branch of AR Brown McFarlane was closed and Bokusui Brown Co., Ltd was established by investment in Bokusui Brown Co., Ltd.  The company began the sale of laboratory instruments, expanded the specialized chemical products it handled such as resin raw materials and catalysts, and contributed to the technological progress of the Japanese economy during the period of high economic growth.</p>

                  AR Brown became independent from Bokusui Co., Ltd. in 1987.  While the deflationary recession continued after the collapse of the bubble economy, AR Brown continued building the foundations of its independence, introduced new biotechnology and nanotechnology, and contributed to the evolution of genetic engineering and improvements in medical technology.  In 1995, the company name was changed to AR Brown Co., Ltd.</p>

                  A new management philosophy and vision for 2007 was set.  The source of the company’s growth was determined to be in the growth of "People", and a workshop for the permeation of this philosophy was initiated giving top priority to the motivation of employees.  During this time, financial reforms were realized after overcoming the Lehman shock, and in 2011, a shift to consolidated management was conducted by the establishment of overseas corporations in China in 2011 and Thailand in 2014.</p>
